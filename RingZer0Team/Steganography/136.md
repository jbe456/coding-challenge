## Solution

We first open the `ogg` audio file with a [hexadecimal editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/). We could also take a look at the field `COMMENTS` in the file media information.

```

There is a tip: `Looking something hidden in the Tag/Raw data ? Nothing here, but check the works related to Joseph Fourier`.

After some research, we find that it is possible to [display a specific image in the spectrum analysis of an audio file](https://solusipse.net/blog/post/basic-methods-of-audio-steganography-spectrograms/). Our goal is then to do a spectrum analysis of the audio file.

Using [Spek](http://spek.cc/) or [Sonic Visualizer](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/), we obtain the following diagram:

We can see a sign that looks like a QR code in the spectrum: in fact it is an [Aztec code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code). After some manipulation using Gimp to process the image we obtain the following aztec code that we can scan using a phone barcode scanner application like [QR Code Reader Extreme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fancyapp.qrcode.barcode.scanner.reader&hl=en):

And we obtain the text `the flag is: mathsRulesTheUniverse`
