## Solution

We first open the `gif` file with a [hexadecimal editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/). Searching for keywords we find the string `flag.gif` which is suspicious.

Checking the magic number at the beginning of the file, it seems to be a GIF file as it starts with the bytes `47 49 46 38 39 61` or `GIF89a` in ASCII, but looking at the end of it, the file should end with the byte code `3B` but does not. Some bytes have been appended afterwards.

In fact, a simple steganography technique to hide data into a gif is to append an archive file at the end of the original gif file. Such file is readable by both gif programs and archive programs because gif files keep all of their information [at the beginning in the header](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/GIF), while archive files keep them at then end in the footer through the [Central Directory Record for ZIP files](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/ZIP) or [Archive Header for RAR files](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/RAR).

In fact the file is the concatenation of a GIF and a RAR file: the file end with the RAR terminator bytes `C4 3D 7B 00 40 07 00` and we are able to find the footer of a GIF `3B` followed by the magic number of a RAR `3B 52 61 72 21 1A 07 00`.

Using 7-zip to open the file, we find out that there is indeed an archive containing a file `flag.gif`.

![hidden-gif](./122/flag.gif "Hidden Gif")

And we obtain the flag `FLAG-**************`.
