# Security thru obscurity!

## Solution

The first time we load the page we have the following message: `You don't have admin access.`. A refresh few seconds later leads to a different message: `Expired cookie.`

Looking at the cookies we find the following: `AUTH=Z3Vlc3QsN2E4NDc1N2UwNDg5ZTM4YywxNDgxNTEyODk5LGZhbHNlOmQzMDcyODBjYjk0ZjBkODliOTczMTY0NmQ3MzVhMGE3`

Using a [Base64 decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/), we obtain: `guest,7a84757e0489e38c,1481512899,false:d307280cb94f0d89b9731646d735a0a7`

When we update the first part of the cookie we obtain a different message: `Look's like someone is trying to hack our system (Invalid MD5).` In fact, the second part of the cookie is the MD5 hash of the first part. We therefore have to update also the second with the MD5 hash of the first part using a [MD5 "encrypter"](http://www.md5online.org/md5-encrypt.html).

In fact the cookie value looks like: 
```
part_1 = username,salt?,timestamp,admin_flag
cookie = part_1:md5_hash(part_1)
```

Since the message is about an expired date, we update the timestamp part using a new date in the future: `let date = new Date(); date.setYear(2100); date.getTime();// 4132265442871`. After multiple attempts, we also update the username to `admin` and switch the "admin" flag from `false` to `true`. We obtain the following value `admin,7a84757e0489e38c,4132265442871,true:4f4f6c45553d562172e6f46131f4f433` that we encode [back to Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/). 

We then set the cookie using JavaScript `document.cookie = 'AUTH=YWRtaW4sN2E4NDc1N2UwNDg5ZTM4Yyw0MTMyMjY1NDQyODcxLHRydWU6NGY0ZjZjNDU1NTNkNTYyMTcyZTZmNDYxMzFmNGY0MzM=;'` and obtain the flag `FLAG-************************`.
