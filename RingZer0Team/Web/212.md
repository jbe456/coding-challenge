# Big Brother is watching

## Solution

Using the given tip, we search about a way to prevent Google engine from indexing content. We then find out that a website can use `robots.txt` for such a purpose.

From [google documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en):

```
A robots.txt file is a file at the root of your site that indicates those parts of your site you don’t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers).
```

We then look at https://ringzer0team.com/robots.txt:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/
```

And by going to https://ringzer0team.com/16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/, we obtain the Flag `FLAG-G5swO95w0c7R5fq0sa85nVs5dK49O04i`
