## Solution

Using the given tip, we search about a way to prevent Google engine from indexing content. We then find out that a website can use `robots.txt` for such a purpose.

From [google documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en):

```
A robots.txt file is a file at the root of your site that indicates those parts of your site you donâ€™t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers).
```

We then look at https://ringzer0team.com/robots.txt:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/
```

And by going to https://ringzer0team.com/16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/, we obtain the Flag `FLAG-********************************`
